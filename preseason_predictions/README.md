# Preseason Predictions

### Goal

Generate win total distributions through game-by-game win probabilty predictions. 

### Approach

I can either:

* predict each game next season based on the two team's data
* predict the end of season quality of a team and then derive/predict win probabilities for each game

I don't really like the second approach. I haven't thought about it too much but I can't get around the fact that we will be predicting the end of season quality of a team and then using that to find the probability that the team wins each game that made up their season results. I need to think about this some more. But also this could just be a bad approach because we are going from multiple factors to predicting one number, then predicting the game probabilities from one number. If there are factors that are more important for individual game predictions than the season strength predictions then we lose some predictive power.
